# Vechiclecount
Vehicle counting is a common application of computer vision and AI technology that involves detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time from video feeds or images. The technology has several important use cases, including traffic management, parking management, toll collection, and security monitoring.
In security monitoring, vehicle counting can help to detect suspicious vehicles and track their movements, which can be useful in preventing crime or terrorist activities. 
IMPORTANT LIBRARIES:-
Numpy: NumPy is a Python library used for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, as well as tools for working with these arrays. The key feature of NumPy is its ability to perform fast mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
cv2 : cv2, or OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of image processing and computer vision algorithms. It was originally developed by Intel in 1999 and has since been maintained by a community of developers.
Pandas: Pandas is a popular open-source data analysis and manipulation library for the Python programming language. It provides a fast and efficient way to work with structured data such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, and more.
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular open-source data visualization library for the Python programming language. It provides a range of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
STEPS:
Collect video data: The first step is we collected video data of the area where you want to count vehicles. This is done using surveillance cameras or other video sources.
Pre-process the video data: we have collected the video data, we prepossessed it to prepare it for analysis. This may involve tasks such as converting the video to a common format, resizing the video, and filtering out noise.
Detect vehicles: The next step is to detect vehicles in the video frames. This is done using object detection algorithms such as create background subtractor This algorithm can detect and classify objects in the video frames, including vehicles.
Track vehicles: After detecting vehicles, we tracked them across video frames. This can be done using object tracking algorithms such as dilated filters. These algorithms can predict the position of the vehicle in the next frame and update the tracking accordingly.
Count vehicles: Finally, we counted the number of vehicles by analysing the tracked objects over time. This may involve setting up virtual gates or lines in the video frames and counting the number of times a tracked object crosses the gate or line.
Analyse the results: we have counted the vehicles, and analysed the results to gain insights into traffic patterns, vehicle flow, and other metrics of interest.
